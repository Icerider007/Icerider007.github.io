# How to Survive a Monday Like a Viking

## Introduction: Mondays are Coming
Mondays. You wake up, look out the window, and realize the weekend has abandoned you. The coffee machine glares at you with a smug sense of superiority. Your email inbox is a digital pit of despair. But today, we’re not going to approach this Monday like mere mortals. No. Today, we’re going to attack Monday like a Viking warrior charging into battle (but with more caffeine and fewer axes, probably).

### Step 1: Summon the Monday Battle Cry
First, you need a proper war cry. Something that’ll wake you up better than any alarm clock ever could. Stand in front of your mirror, hands on your hips, and bellow your new mantra:  
*“NOT TODAY, MONDAY!”*  
It’s important to shout this loud enough that your neighbors are mildly concerned, but not so loud that they call the authorities. A good balance here is key.

### Step 2: Armor Up
Vikings never went into battle without their armor, and you should never go into Monday without yours. Here’s a quick checklist for the modern Monday Viking:

- **Coffee Mug of Destiny**: This mug should be the size of your head and say something like "World’s Okayest Employee."
- **Email Shield**: Block the first 25 emails. No one expects you to answer before 10 AM anyway.
- **Outfit of Power**: Wear something that screams "I'm only here for the snacks," while still maintaining plausible professionalism.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Steed (A.K.A. Your Desk Chair)
A Viking wouldn’t ride into battle on just any horse, and you shouldn’t conquer Monday on just any chair. Adjust your chair so you sit like the ruler of your cubicle kingdom. Tilt that backrest. Swivel like it’s the last thing you’ll ever do. If your chair doesn’t have wheels, consider *strategic chair pirating* from a co-worker. (Note: Do this after they’ve left for lunch, so you can claim plausible deniability.)

### Step 4: Fight the Email Dragon
The email inbox is your arch-nemesis. Its sole purpose is to bury you in messages you’ll never have time to answer. To defeat it, you must apply **The Viking Rule of Three**:
1. **Respond to three emails**.
2. **Delete three emails**.
3. **Pretend the rest don’t exist**.

### Step 5: The Snack Raid
Vikings plundered villages for treasures. You plunder the office kitchen for snacks. It’s the same thing, really. Pro tip: If anyone questions your seventh trip to the snack counter, just say you’re "ensuring team morale." Nobody argues with that.

### Step 6: The Zoom Battle Arena
Zoom meetings are the modern-day equivalent of Viking battles—except with fewer swords and more awkward pauses. To conquer the Zoom battlefield:
- Ensure your background suggests you’re both professional *and* fun. A tasteful plant says, “I’m grounded,” but a cat in the background says, “I might also nap mid-meeting.”
- Mute your mic immediately after entering the meeting. This avoids the dreaded "Am I muted?" echo, which is the Viking equivalent of fumbling your sword.
- Nod enthusiastically at whatever's being said, even if you have no idea what's happening. Nodding is your battle strategy.

### Step 7: Survive the Afternoon Slump
By 2 PM, you will feel the weight of Monday pressing on your very soul. This is your darkest hour. But like all great Viking warriors, this is where you show your strength. Get up from your desk, stretch, and possibly raid the kitchen again. The afternoon slump can be beaten with the sacred Viking technique of “definitely-not-procrastination-but-creative-recharging.”

### Step 8: Victory Lap (4:59 PM)
You made it. The clock strikes 4:59 PM. You glance at your to-do list (which now has more things on it than when you started, but we don’t talk about that). You throw your arms into the air and scream:  
*“FOR ASGARD!”*  
You survived Monday. Time to sail off into the sunset (or, you know, the parking lot) with your head held high, because tomorrow? Tomorrow is Tuesday. And that’s Future You’s problem.

## Conclusion: Be the Viking of Your Cubicle Kingdom
Mondays are hard, but so were the lives of Vikings. And if they could sail across treacherous seas, battle fierce enemies, and survive on nothing but raw determination and mead, then you can survive a couple of Zoom calls and an overfull inbox. So raise your coffee mug high, warrior! **Monday is no match for you.**
